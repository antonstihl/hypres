_hypermedia presentation_

Use HTML to build an amazing slideshow. The whole software industry is moving toward everything-as-code - so should presentation tooling!

In addition to the opinionated core functionality (script) and stylesheet, the full power of HTML, JS and CSS is at the author's fingertips.

Here is a demo presentation with a hypres presentation in action: https://antonstihl.github.io/hypres

## Getting started

### Installation

Add the below script and stylesheet to the HTML `<head>`.

```html
<head>
  ...
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/hypres@latest/script.js"></script>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/hypres@latest/styles.css" />
</head>
```

If you fancy managing packages there is also `npm install hypres`, with which you instead reference the node_modules files.

### Core utilities

The basic building blocks - the bread and butter - of hypres are:

1. `<section>` element

One section corresponds to one slide.

2. `hp-f` attribute

The `hp-f` attribute denotes a `f`ocusable element. Elements are put in focus (and revealed) one by one, effectively directing the audience's attention.

So, the HTML code for a pretty and simple slide (section) with focus-driven animations can be this simple.

```html
<section>
  <h2>Lorem ipsum</h2>
  <p hp-f>Quisque ut lobortis libero.</p>
  <ul>
    <li hp-f>Sed</li>
    <li hp-f>Sodales</li>
    <li hp-f>Arcu</li>
    <li hp-f>Purus</li>
  </ul>
  <p hp-f>Morbi vitae eros hendrerit, tempor libero eget, vehicula sapien.</p>
</section>
```

Declaring your presentation in HTML code is fast, powerful and flexible. Especially in comparison with implementing the same in PowerPoint/Google Slides/Keynote and the like.

### Example slideshow

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/hypres/script.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/hypres/styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <section>
      <h1>My presentation about stuff</h1>
      <p hp-f>Why are we here?</p>
      <p hp-f>How do I make you listen?</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>Let's get to it...</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Tooling</h2>
      <ul>
        <li hp-f>Tool A</li>
        <li hp-f>Tool B</li>
        <li hp-f>Tool c</li>
      </ul>
      <p hp-f>I guess now I have your attention!</p>
    </section>
  </body>
</html>
```

### How does it work?

hypres will start by showing the first section. When focusing next (arrow right / `n` key), the first focusable will receive focus and be revealed. As focus traverses the elements in the section, the default hypres stylesheet helps the audience focus on one thing at a time.

When there are no more focusables in a section, the arrow down key (or `n` key) will reveal the next section into view.

If you want to go back a section, just press arrow up key. Your entire state will stay in the DOM, so no more "let me just revert 20 clicks from slide 4 to show you a thing on slide 2 and then do 20 clicks forward again to get back to where I was".

### Reminder

Keep in mind that YOU are the presentation. The slideshow is just your visual aid. Good luck!

## Keyboard controls

| Key              | Action                       | Comment                                           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Arrow right/left | Next/previous focus          |                                                   |
| `l` / `h`        | Next/previous focus          | VIM-style                                         |
| Arrow down/up    | Next/previous slide          |                                                   |
| `j` / `k`        | Next/previous slide          | VIM-style                                         |
| `n` / `b`        | Next/previous focus or slide | Next focus if any left on slide, else next slide. |
| `c`              | Toggle cursor on/off         |                                                   |

NB: The omission of mouse-click controls is intentional. Navigating a browser and putting the window in focus is typically clicky by nature, so hypres will not jump the gun on your presentation progress. If you do want click controls, however, feel free to extend the functionality with JavaScript. For example, the global `hypres.next()` function should behave like a default mouse left-click in PowerPoint.

## Reference

### Implementation philosophy

hypres uses the DOM as its state - no persistent JavaScript state exists. Current section, current focus etc are _only_ persisted as classes on the elements. The hypermedia encodes the state and available actions.

This approach yields the significant benefit that extension, styling etc are very accessible to everyone.

### JavaScript API
